           This research article provides a general overview of nerve agents specifically exposure 
           and the effectiveness of each group. The nerve agents are assorted into 3 groups, Novichok (A),
           German (G) & Venomous (V). Nerve agents with increased inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase will lead to an 
           of fatality. While factoring in the method of exposure, we can conclude that group A has the higest potency
           and leads to an increased risk of fatality if exposed even in extremely small doses. Dosage testing is
           measured using LCt50 and LD50 values (toxic unit and median lethal dose). Limited research has been done
           on group A due the lack of russian publication on the topic but has been found to have several advantages
           over other nerve agents through research published by Tonas C. C. Franca et al. who of which has found that
           compounds A-230, A-232 & A-234 have the lowest LCt<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> values <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012).</a>.

        <pre>
          Nerve Agents are a group of highly poisonous chemicals specifically engineered for chemical
          warfare. They are part of a group called organophosphates (OP) and were originally developed as 
          insecticides & pesticides. Nerve agents can be be absorbed through skin, inhalation & digestion.
          The danger lies in its ability to bind to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown
          of the acetylecholine, a key neurotransmitter used to carry messages from the brain to your muscles.
          Nerve agents were first created developed in the 1930s by Germany and were subsequently named Group G or G-series
          agents. <a href="#(Johnson et al., 2015).">(Johnson et al., 2015)</a>.

        <pre>
          Nerve agents are a subgroup of chemical agents, an
          Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease responsible for the build-up of mucus within the lungs
          and the digestive system <a href="#(NHS Choices, 2021).">(NHS Choices, 2021)</a>. The disease is caused by a mutation within
          the CFTR gene (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which affects how
          salt and water move across cells (NHS Choices, 2021). CF is a recessive disease, which means
          that for someone to have the disease, both copies of their CFTR gene must have a mutation
          <a href="#(CF Genetics: The basics, no date).">(CF Genetics: The basics, no date).</a> Specifically, to have the disease, one copy of the faulty
          CFTR gene is inherited from both parents. Each parent would have one working copy and
          one faulty copy of the gene; they are seen as carriers of the disease. The offspring of the
          parents would therefore have a 25% chance of inheriting the disease <a href="#(Cystic fibrosis, no date).">(Cystic fibrosis, no date).</a>

          Statistically, around 10,800 people have CF in the UK (1 in every 2,500 babies born). Globally,
          the disease affects roughly 100,000 people <a href="#(FAQs, no date).">(FAQs, no date).</a>

          ‘The median predicted age of survival for individuals with CF has increased to over 37 years’
          (Wickii and Edward 2010, p. 58). But as of 2023, the average life expectancy for CF patients is
          50 years, with some patients living up to their 80’s <a href="#(Cystic fibrosis itself, longer life expectancy are possible factors, research suggests, 2023).">(Cystic fibrosis itself, longer life expectancy are possible factors, research suggests, 2023).</a>

          Currently, there’s no cure for the disease, but there are treatments and therapies that allow
          the symptoms to be more manageable to live with (NHS Choices, 2021). They include
          medications (e.g., antibiotics for chest infections), airway clearance devices and lung
          transplants (our focus), and some dietary advice <a href="#(Cystic fibrosis, no date).">(Cystic fibrosis, no date).</a>

      <h3 id="High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO)">High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO)</h3>
      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
        At the University of Minnesota, researchers developed a device to replace manual chest
        percussion therapy in 1985, where the device would help clear mucus secretions from the
        lungs of CF patients <a href="#(Respiratory health, no date).">(Respiratory health, no date).</a> This new device was the birth of HFCWO.

        In this method of treatment, an inflatable vest is attached to an air pulse generator.
        The air-pulse generator sends air through two hoses to the inflatable vest, allowing the vest to
        rapidly inflate and deflate (vibrating at a rapid pace), at roughly 20 times per second. This
        vibrating process allows the chest to loosen and thin mucus that’s trapped within the lungs. This
        would cause the patient to cough up mucus, at roughly every 5 minutes, due to the pressure
        created by the vibrating vest. <a href="#(High-frequency chest wall oscillation, the vest, no date).">(High-frequency chest wall oscillation, the vest, no date)</a>. See
        Figure 1 to see the apparatus of HFCWO.

      <h3 id="HFCWO compared with lung transplants.">HFCWO compared with lung transplants.</h3>
      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
        It has been found that HFCWO provides physiological mechanisms by which secretions in the lungs
        are loosened from the airway wall and moved proximally in the respiratory tree. To
        support this, Tomkiewicz et al. were able to demonstrate an in vitro reduction in both
        spinnability of mucus and its viscoelasticity (a substance exhibiting both elastic and viscous
        behaviour) properties. They found that ‘the mucus material became more fluid, and more
        easily cleared from the airway’ <a href="#(Tecklin, J., 2005).">(Tecklin, J., 2005).</a> This shows that HFCWO
        is an effective treatment for CF patients, due to its ability to free up the wairways from the mucus
        that previously caused blockage.

        However, a downside to using HFCWO is its practicality. The device is heavy and not very portable. If a
        patient were to use it by themselves, they may struggle to move it around to their desired
        position <a href="#(PPT, no date).">(PPT, no date).</a> This would cause difficulties in carrying out the method
        of treatment.

        Lung transplants are where one/both lung(s) are removed from the patient through surgery
        and are replaced with lung implants of the chosen donor(s). The donor(s) and the patient
        must have matching blood groups <a href="#(Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date).">(Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date)</a>. See
        Figure 2 to see the specific cuts made in the lung vessels in a lung transplant.

        Figure 2. An overview of lung transplantation <a href="#(Lung Transplantation, 2023).">(Lung Transplantation, 2023).</a>

        The main benefits of lung transplants for CF patients are an increased life expectancy and
        a better quality of life <a href="#(NHS Website, no date).">(NHS Website, no date).</a> It has been concluded that ‘Lung
        transplantation will remain a cornerstone of treatment of terminal pulmonary disease in CF
        for years to come’ <a href="(Huang W, Smith AT, Korotun M, Iacono A, Wang J, 2023).">(Huang W, Smith AT, Korotun M, Iacono A, Wang J, 2023)</a>. They found  
        that ‘The median survival of Cf patients after lung transplant is 8.3 years.' From this, lung
        transplants are a vital method of treatment for patients diagnosed with CF. However, 8.3 years
        can be considered short, so it can be debated whether lung transplants are considered effective.

        The main risks of lung transplants include a high chance of death in the first few months after
        the operation, and that the procedure comes with surgical risks (e.g., excessive bleeding) <a href="#(Benefits and
        risks of a lung transplant, no date).">(Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date) </a>.
       
        There is therefore question of whether patients would opt for this method of treatment, instead of HFCWO.

      <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
       <p class="ex1">
         <pre>
        HFCWO can be considered a more suitable treatment. It makes the symptoms more bearable <a href="#(High-frequency chest wall oscillation, the vest, no date)">(High-frequency chest wall oscillation, the vest, no date)</a>, thus making it
        highly valid, alongside evidential support in its ability, but its practicality puts the vest at a disadvantage <a href="#(PPT, no date)">(PPT, no date)</a>. Lung
        transplants can increase a patient’s life expectancy, but vitally, the first few months of a
        successful transplant results in higher chances of death <a href="#(Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date).">(Benefits and risks of a lung transplant, no date). </a>
