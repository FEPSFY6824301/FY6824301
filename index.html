         <pre>
           This research article provides a general overview of nerve agents specifically exposure 
           and the effectiveness of each group. The nerve agents are assorted into 3 groups, Novichok (A),
           German (G) & Venomous (V). Nerve agents with increased inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase will lead to 
           increased likelihood of fatality. While factoring in the method of exposure, we can conclude that group A has 
           the higest potency and leads to an increased risk of fatality if exposed even in extremely small doses. Dosage
           testing is measured using LCt50 and LD50 values (toxic unit and median lethal dose). Limited research has been 
           done on Group A due the lack of Russian publication on the topic but has been found to have several advantages
           over other nerve agents through research published by Tonas C. C. Franca et al. who of which has found that
           compounds A-230, A-232 & A-234 have the lowest LCt<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> values <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012).</a>.

        <pre>
          Nerve Agents are a group of highly poisonous chemicals specifically engineered for chemical
          warfare. They are part of a group called organophosphates (OP) and were originally developed as 
          insecticides & pesticides. Nerve agents can be be absorbed through skin, inhalation & digestion.
          The danger lies in its ability to bind to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown
          of the acetylecholine, a key neurotransmitter used to carry messages from the brain to your muscles.
          Nerve agents were first created developed in the 1930s by Germany and were subsequently named Group G or G-series
          agents. <a href="#(Johnson et al., 2015).">(Johnson et al., 2015)</a>.

         All compounds contain a phosphate ion double bonded to an oxygen ion. This forms the backbone of the compounds
         and is where the name organophosphates comes from. While being great pesticides they are extremely lethal.

         From the differences, the G series has Fluorine (F) bonded to its Phosphorus (P) core. Whereas V sereis has Sulfur
         bonded to its core. Another difference is G-series agents are esters (Oxygen is in the middle of the chain) but
         V-series agents are easters with Sulphur in the middle of the chain. Novichok agents have similarities from both
         groups as V-series & G-series agents were used for development. Most Novichok agents have a Fluorine bonded to the 
         Phospohorus core.

        The lead symptoms of poisoning involve contractions of the pupils, nausea and chest tightness with spasms leading
        towards death. Death will often occur due to acute respiratory failure following the blocking of neurojunctions through
        the inhibition of AChE.  Exposure through inhalation and ingestion can often take within seconds to minutes to display
        deteriorating health effects. The chain of symptoms is as follows. Firstly, sense of smell, especially with impure
        nerve agents.  While it may smell unpleasant, it is actually the eyes that give the first visible indication that there
        has been exposure.  For example, in the Tokyo Subway Attacks in 1990s, the Sarin used gave off a fishy musty smell due
        to impure iospropyl leading to a purity of only 35%. People inside subway cars were subjected to a fishy odor & a wetted
        floor full of impure Sarin. The sarin would spill out and vaporize diluting itself with the air. The vaporized sarin
        would attach itself to airborne water particles. These would then attach themselves to pieces of clothing & any exposed skin.

         Chemical weapons are easy to manufacture given the right equipment but hard to store and dangerous to handle. The 
         risks increase with volume produced. The use of binary agents it makes it easier for criminal organizations to safely handle
         nerve agents and deploy them mitigating harm on themselves. Though the increase in technology may have slow down the smuggling
         of goods across the border it certainly hasn’t stopped domestic cases. While Japan might be the largest offender of nerve agents,
         there have been many cases were plots have been uncovered with the intent to cause panic and death. In minute quantities, they
         can cause serious harm to a person. In large quantities, it can easily kill 100s of unsuspecting people. The nervous system is the
         human’s bodies wiring and if it is disrupted, it will quickly lead to death.
