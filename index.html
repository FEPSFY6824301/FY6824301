           This research article provides a general overview of nerve agents specifically exposure and the
           effectiveness of each group. The nerve agents are assorted into 3 groups, Novichok (A), German (G) &
           Venomous (V). Nerve agents with increased inhibition of the enzyme Cholinesterase will lead to an increased 
           likelihood of fatality. While factoring in the method of exposure, we can conclude that group A has the 
           higest potency and leads to an increased risk of fatality if exposed even in extremely small doses. Dosage
           testing is measured using LCt<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> values (toxic unit and median lethal dose). 
           Limited research has been done on Group A due the lack of Russian publication on the topic but has been
           found to have several advantages over other nerve agents through research published by Franca, C,C,T., et al. 
           who of which has found that compounds A-230, A-232 & A-234 have the lowest LCt<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> values. <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012).</a>

      <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
           Nerve Agents are a group of highly poisonous chemicals specifically engineered for chemical
           warfare. They are part of a group called organophosphates (OP) and were originally developed as 
           insecticides & pesticides. Nerve agents can be be absorbed through skin, inhalation & digestion.
           The danger lies in its ability to bind to Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown
           of the Acetylecholine, a key neurotransmitter used to carry messages from the brain to your muscles.
           Nerve agents were first created developed in the 1930s by Germany and were subsequently named Group G or G-series
           agents. <a href="#(Johnson et al., 2015).">(Johnson et al., 2015)</a>.

      <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
           Nerve agents are as the name suggest's chemicals that affect the nervous system. These chemicals inhibit the enzyme
           AChE by attaching themselves onto them. AChE inhibition accounts for major life-threatening effects of nerve agents <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a>
           AChE is responsible for the breakdown & degradation of Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter found in
           nerve terminals. ACh is responsible for the stimulation of the secretion of bodily fluids (sweat & saliva) &
           the contraction of muscles. <a href="#(Moyer, R.A., Sidell, F.R., Salem, H., 2014).">(Moyer, R.A., Sidell, F.R., Salem, H., 2014).</a>
           When AChE is inhibited, it blocks the breakdown of ACh. This leads to the over accumulation of ACh
           receptors resulting in overstimulation. By overstimulating it leads to an increase in the secretion 
           of fluids and seizures. As well as seizures, paralyse to all muscle groups. This also means the diaphragm
           preventing respiration from occurring, leading to death.

      <p class="ex1">
       <pre>
           All compounds contain a phosphate ion double bonded to an oxygen ion. This forms the backbone of the compounds
           and is where the name organophosphates comes from. While being great pesticides they are extremely lethal.

           From the differences, the G series has Fluorine (F) bonded to its Phosphorus (P) core. Whereas V sereis has Sulfur
           bonded to its core. Another difference is G-series agents are esters (Oxygen is in the middle of the chain) but
           V-series agents are esters with Sulphur in the middle of the chain. Novichok agents have similarities from both
           groups as V-series & G-series agents were used for development. Most Novichok agents have a Fluorine bonded to the 
           Phospohorus core.

          Novichok agents were made to be in binary form. This means two inert substances that are combined prior to delivery
          to create the active nerve agent <a href="#(Chai, P., 2018).">(Chai, P., 2018)</a>. Nerve agents, especially A-series agents are stored that way
          for a number of reasons. Firstly, having 2 seperate chemicals limits the likelihood of contamination and accidental
          exposure. Secondly, it increases the shelf life as in unitary form, nerve agents are quite unstable and have a short
          shelf life.   

          For A-series agents, the use of Fluorine greatly increases its attraction to AChE's polar OH. When bonded onto AChE, another
          enzyme is formed

          For acute exposure, the most common sign is miosis (pinpoint pupils) & visual darkness. <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a> 
          A more general symptom is headaches and nausea. This probably caused by inhaling fumes and lack of orientation.
          The primary cause of rapid death after acute nerve agent exposure is respiratory failure.  <a href="#(Carey et al., 2013).">(Carey et al., 2013)</a> 
          Exposure through inhalation and ingestion can often take within seconds to minutes to display deteriorating
          health effects. The chain of symptoms is as follows. Firstly, sense of smell, especially with impure nerve 
          agents. For example, in the Tokyo Subway Attacks in 1990s, the Sarin used gave off a fishy musty smell due
          to excess Isopropyl Alcohol (Murakami, H., 1997) leading to a purity of only 35% <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a> 
          The 600ml of Sarin would spill out forming puddles and vaporize diluting itself with the air. The vaporized Sarin
          would attach itself to airborne water particles. These would then attach themselves to pieces of clothing & any exposed skin.

        <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
          As stated from before, there are many ways that nerve agent exposure can occur. Some forms require a higher dosage to be lethal.
          It also varies from group to group as to how lethal each nerve agent can be. A study was conducted by the University of South Bohemia
          on rats was used to determine these LD<sub>50</sub> figures (Shown in Figure 5). Rats are used for acute toxicity testing, due their
          behavior & genetic characteristics closely resembling those of humans. 

         <img src="AgentsLD50.png" alt="Figure 5" width="548" height="148">

          Figure 5. Toxicities of Some Nerve Agents in Rats at Different Routes of Administration <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012).</a>

          The headings in Figure 5, are intramuscular (IM),subcutaneous (SC) - under the skin, oral (PO),
          intraperitoneal (IP) - injection, percutaneous (PC) - on the skin. From Figure 5, we can see that intramuscular has the least
          LD<sub>50</sub> due to the fact that nerve agents target the neuromuscular junction to prevent ACh from breaking down.
        
          Regarding human testing, such a thing simply cannot occur due to the fact, nerve agents are extremely potent even in low
          quantities. This isn't to say such a case hasn't been studied before. There are
          numerous poisonings using; Sarin, VX & Novichok agents. There has also been widespread documentation
          on the effects of Sarin on humans from the Tokyo Subway incident as well as the Matsumoto incident both
          of which occurred in the late 90s. With many of the people surviving the attacks, it was easy for 
          doctors to gather data on how Sarin affect people.

       <p class="ex1">
         <pre>
          The most lethal of nerve agents are the A-series agents. This is due their Fluorine bonding to the
          Organophosphate center making the overall charge neutral. The altered enzyme also ages extremely slowly making
          it harder to remove the agent

          
         Chemical weapons are easy to manufacture given the right equipment but hard to store and dangerous to handle. The 
         risks increase with volume produced. The use of binary agents it makes it easier for criminal organizations to safely handle
         nerve agents and deploy them mitigating harm on themselves. Though the increase in technology may have slow down the smuggling
         of goods across the border it certainly hasn’t stopped domestic cases. While Japan might be the largest offender of nerve agents,
         there have been many cases were plots have been uncovered with the intent to cause panic and death. In minute quantities, they
         can cause serious harm to a person. In large quantities, it can easily kill 100s of unsuspecting people. The nervous system is the
         human’s bodies wiring and if it is disrupted, it will quickly lead to death.
