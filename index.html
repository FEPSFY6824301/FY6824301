           This research article provides a general overview of nerve agents specifically exposure 
           and the effectiveness of each group. The nerve agents are assorted into 3 groups, Novichok (A),
           German (G) & Venomous (V). Nerve agents with increased inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase will lead to 
           increased likelihood of fatality. While factoring in the method of exposure, we can conclude that group A has 
           the higest potency and leads to an increased risk of fatality if exposed even in extremely small doses. Dosage
           testing is measured using LCt50 and LD50 values (toxic unit and median lethal dose). Limited research has been 
           done on Group A due the lack of Russian publication on the topic but has been found to have several advantages
           over other nerve agents through research published by Tonas C. C. Franca et al. who of which has found that
           compounds A-230, A-232 & A-234 have the lowest LCt<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> values. <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012).</a>

        <pre>
          Nerve Agents are a group of highly poisonous chemicals specifically engineered for chemical
          warfare. They are part of a group called organophosphates (OP) and were originally developed as 
          insecticides & pesticides. Nerve agents can be be absorbed through skin, inhalation & digestion.
          The danger lies in its ability to bind to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown
          of the acetylecholine, a key neurotransmitter used to carry messages from the brain to your muscles.
          Nerve agents were first created developed in the 1930s by Germany and were subsequently named Group G or G-series
          agents. <a href="#(Johnson et al., 2015).">(Johnson et al., 2015)</a>.

      <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
          Nerve agents are as the name suggest's chemicals that affect the nervous system. These chemicals inhibit the enzyme
          AChE by attaching themselves onto them. AChE inhibition accounts for major life-threatening effects of nerve agents <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a>

      <p class="ex1">
       <pre>
          All compounds contain a phosphate ion double bonded to an oxygen ion. This forms the backbone of the compounds
          and is where the name organophosphates comes from. While being great pesticides they are extremely lethal.

          From the differences, the G series has Fluorine (F) bonded to its Phosphorus (P) core. Whereas V sereis has Sulfur
          bonded to its core. Another difference is G-series agents are esters (Oxygen is in the middle of the chain) but
          V-series agents are esters with Sulphur in the middle of the chain. Novichok agents have similarities from both
          groups as V-series & G-series agents were used for development. Most Novichok agents have a Fluorine bonded to the 
          Phospohorus core.

         The lead symptoms of poisoning involve pinpoint pupils (one of the earliest signs of sarin exposure);blurred or
         dimmed vision, rhinorrhea, headache, hypersecretion by salivary, lacrimal, sweat, and bronchial glands; nausea;
         vomiting; diarrhea; crampy abdominal pain; bowel and bladder incontinence; and dyspnoea.
         Death will often occur due to acute respiratory failure following the blocking of neurojunctions through
         the inhibition of AChE.  Exposure through inhalation and ingestion can often take within seconds to minutes to display
         deteriorating health effects. The chain of symptoms is as follows. Firstly, sense of smell, especially with impure
         nerve agents.  While it may smell unpleasant, it is actually the eyes that give the first visible indication that there
         has been exposure.  For example, in the Tokyo Subway Attacks in 1990s, the Sarin used gave off a fishy musty smell due
         to impure iospropyl (Murakami, H., 1997) leading to a purity of only 35% <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a> 
         The 600ml of Sarin would spill out forming puddles and vaporize diluting itself with the air. The vaporized sarin
         would attach itself to airborne water particles. These would then attach themselves to pieces of clothing & any exposed skin.

        <p class="ex1">
         As stated from before, there are many ways that nerve agent exposure can occur. Some forms require a higher dosage to be lethal.
         It also varies from group to group as to how lethal each nerve agent can be. A study was conducted by the University of South Bohemia
         on rats was used to determine these LD<sub>50</sub> figures (Shown in Figure 5). Rats are used for acute toxicity testing, due their
         genetic, biological and behavior characteristics closely resembling those of humans.

        Figure 5. Toxicities of Some Nerve Agents in Rats at Different Routes of Administration <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012)</a>

         Regarding human testing, such a thing simply cannot occur due to the fact, nerve agents are extremely
         potent even in low quantities. This isn't to say such a case hasn't been studied before. There are
         numerous poisonings using; Sarin, VX & Novichok agents. There has also been widespread documentation
         on the effects of Sarin on humans from the Tokyo Subway incident as well as the Matsumoto incident both
         of which occured in the late 90s.

         Chemical weapons are easy to manufacture given the right equipment but hard to store and dangerous to handle. The 
         risks increase with volume produced. The use of binary agents it makes it easier for criminal organizations to safely handle
         nerve agents and deploy them mitigating harm on themselves. Though the increase in technology may have slow down the smuggling
         of goods across the border it certainly hasn’t stopped domestic cases. While Japan might be the largest offender of nerve agents,
         there have been many cases were plots have been uncovered with the intent to cause panic and death. In minute quantities, they
         can cause serious harm to a person. In large quantities, it can easily kill 100s of unsuspecting people. The nervous system is the
         human’s bodies wiring and if it is disrupted, it will quickly lead to death.
