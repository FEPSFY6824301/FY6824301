         <pre>
           This research article provides a general overview of nerve agents, specifically the exposure and the effectiveness
           of each group. The nerve agents are assorted into 3 groups, Novichok (A), German (G) & Venomous (V). Nerve agents
           with increased inhibition of the enzyme Cholinesterase will lead to an increased likelihood of fatality. While
           factoring in the method of exposure, we can conclude that A-series agents have the  highest toxicity and an 
           increased risk of fatality if exposed even in extremely small doses. Dosage testing is measured using LCt<sub>50</sub> & LD<sub>50</sub>
           values (toxic unit and median lethal dose). 
           Limited research has been done on A-series agents due the lack of Russian publication on the topic. Though has 
           been they found to have several advantages over other nerve agents through research published by 
           Franca, C,C,T., et al. who of which has found that compounds A-230, A-232 & A-234 have the lowest LCt<sub>50</sub> and 
           LD<sub>50</sub> values. <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012)</a>

        <pre>
           Nerve agents are a group of highly poisonous chemicals specifically engineered for chemical warfare. They 
           are part of a group called organophosphates (OP) and were originally developed as insecticides & pesticides.
           Nerve agents can be be absorbed through skin, inhalation & digestion. The danger lies in its ability to bind
           to Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the Acetylcholine, a key 
           neurotransmitter used to carry messages from the brain to your muscles. Nerve agents were first created developed
           in the 1930s by Germany and were subsequently named Group G or G-series agents. <a href="#(Johnson et al., 2015).">(Johnson et al., 2015)</a>.

      <p class="ex1">
        <pre>
           Nerve agents are, as the name suggests, chemicals that affect the nervous system. These chemicals inhibit the
           enzyme AChE by attaching themselves onto them. AChE inhibition accounts for major life-threatening effects of
           nerve agents <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006)</a>     AChE is responsible for the 
           breakdown & degradation of Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter found in nerve terminals. ACh is responsible
           for the stimulation of the secretion of bodily fluids (sweat & saliva) & the contraction of muscles. 
           <a href="#(Moyer, R.A., Sidell, F.R., Salem, H., 2014).">(Moyer, R.A., Sidell, F.R., Salem, H., 2014)</a>  When AChE is inhibited,
           it blocks the breakdown of ACh. This leads to the over accumulation of ACh receptors resulting in overstimulation.
           By overstimulating it leads to an increase in the secretion of fluids and seizures. As well as seizures, paralyse
           to all muscle groups. This will prevent the diaphragm from relaxing preventing respiration from occurring, 
           leading to death.

       <pre>
           All compounds contain a phosphate ion double bonded to an oxygen ion. This forms the backbone of the compounds
           and is where the name organophosphates comes from. While being great pesticides they are extremely lethal.

           From the differences, the G series has Fluorine (F) bonded to its Phosphorus (P) core. Whereas V series has 
           Sulfur bonded to its core. Another difference is G-series agents are esters (Oxygen is in the middle of the
           chain) but V-series agents have Oxygen esters & Sulfur esters in the middle of the chain. Novichok agents
           have similarities from both groups as V-series & G-series agents were used for development. Most Novichok
           agents have the same core & the same branched groups with the Phosphorus core being surrounded by the same 
           groups.

           Novichok agents were made to be in binary form. This means two inert substances that are combined prior to 
           delivery to create the active nerve agent. <a href="#(Chai, P., 2018).">(Chai, P., 2018)</a> Nerve agents, especially A-series agents 
           are stored that way for a number of reasons. Firstly, having 2 seperate chemicals limits the likelihood of
           contamination and accidental exposure. Secondly, it increases the shelf life as in unitary form, nerve agents
           are quite unstable and have a short shelf life. Finally, in 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was
           ratified and Russia was developing its own nerve agents. Novichok intermediates (binary agents) are not 
           included on the CWC list of banned items therefore, Russia has circumnavigated restrictions imposed on the 
           production of nerve agents. <a href="#(Kuca, K., 2018).">(Kuca, K., 2018)</a>

           For acute exposure, the most common sign is miosis (pinpoint pupils) & visual darkness. <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a> 
           A more general symptom is headaches and nausea. This is caused by inhaling fumes and lack of orientation.
           The primary cause of rapid death after acute nerve agent exposure is respiratory failure.  <a href="#(Carey et al., 2013).">(Carey et al., 2013)</a> 
           Exposure through inhalation and ingestion can often take within seconds to minutes to display deteriorating
           health effects. Sense of smell is a good way of detecting nerve agents especially with impure nerve agents. 
           For example, in the Tokyo Subway Attacks in 1990s, the Sarin used gave off a fishy musty smell due to excess
           Isopropyl Alcohol (Murakami, H., 1997) leading to a purity of only 35% <a href="#(Tokuda et al., 2006).">(Tokuda et al., 2006).</a> The 600ml of Sarin 
           would spill out forming puddles and vaporize diluting itself with the air. The vaporized Sarin would attach 
           itself to airborne water particles. These would then attach themselves to pieces of clothing & any exposed skin.

           As stated from before, there are many ways that nerve agent exposure can occur. Some forms require a higher
           dosage to be lethal. It also varies from group to group as to how lethal each nerve agent can be. A study
           was conducted by the University of South Bohemia on rats was used to determine these LD<sub>50</sub> figures 
           (Shown in Figure 5). Rats are used for acute toxicity testing, due their behaviour & genetic characteristics
           closely resembling those of humans. 

           <img src="AgentsLD50.png" alt="Figure 5" width="548" height="148">

           Figure 5. Toxicities of Some Nerve Agents in Rats at Different Routes of Administration <a href="#(Bajgar, J., 2012).">(Bajgar, J., 2012).</a>

           The headings in Figure 5, are intramuscular (IM),subcutaneous (SC) - under the skin, oral (PO),
           intraperitoneal (IP) - injection, percutaneous (PC) - on the skin. From Figure 5, we can see that intramuscular 
           has the least LD<sub>50</sub> due to the fact that nerve agents target the neuromuscular junction to prevent 
           ACh from breaking down. Figure 5 also shows VX has a lower LD<sub>50</sub> than all G-series agents.
        
           Regarding human testing, such a thing simply cannot occur due to the fact, nerve agents are extremely 
           potent even in low quantities. This isn't to say such a case hasn't been studied before. There are
           numerous poisonings using; Sarin, VX & Novichok agents. There has also been widespread documentation
           on the effects of Sarin on humans from the Tokyo subway incident as well as the Matsumoto incident both
           of which occurred in the mid 90s. With many of the people surviving the attacks, it was easy for 
           doctors to gather data on how Sarin affects people over a short course as well as long course of time.

      <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
       <p class="ex1">
         <pre>
           The ability to bind onto AChE and not be removed is what makes nerve agents lethal. The time at which it takes
           for nerve agents to show symptoms is fast and can be without warning especially the dark vision. Furthermore 
           some of the early symptom signs are very common among colds and flu so people can be very dismissive. The long
           lasting effects are just as bad with paralysis.  Overall, the lack of warning signs plus immediate common symptoms
           make nerve agents a silent killer when in pure form.
